Blocking authentication transfer in Entra ID is a critical security control that helps protect against token theft and replay attacks by preventing the use of device tokens to silently authenticate on other devices or browsers. When authentication transfer is enabled, aÂ threat actor who gains access to one device can access resources to non-approved devices, bypassing standard authentication and device compliance checks. By blocking this flow, organizations can ensure that each authentication request must originate from the original device, maintaining the integrity of the device compliance and user session context.
