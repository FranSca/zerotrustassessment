A threat actor or a well-intentioned but uninformed employee can create a new Entra tenant if there are no restrictions in place. Without proper controls, this action fractures the identity perimeter by spawning a tenant wholly outside the organization's governance and visibility and introduce risk though a shadow identity platform that can be exploited for token issuance, brand impersonation, consent phishing, or persistent staging infrastructure. Since the rogue tenant might not be tethered to the enterprise’s administrative or monitoring planes, traditional defenses are blind to its creation, activity, and potential misuse. The risk is compounded by the plausible deniability and innocence of the actor—making it not only a technical vulnerability but a governance blind spot. 

Threat actors can target these weakly secured environments through social engineering or credential theft, establishing their initial foothold. Once inside, threat actors can exploit the lack of standardized security controls to establish persistence through backdoor accounts or applications. Privilege escalation follows, as many shadow tenants have poorly defined admin roles. From this vantage point, attackers perform internal reconnaissance across connected services, particularly if employees used corporate credentials in the unmanaged tenants. They then access data in both the shadow tenant and potentially the main corporate environment. This lateral movement often remains undetected since the rogue tenant exists outside corporate monitoring, allowing attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data or launch further attacks while security teams remain blind to the threat originating from the unmanaged tenant.
