Threat actors target privileged accounts to escalate access within Entra tenants, exfiltrate data, and establish persistence. Without a Just-In-Time (JIT) activation model, administrative privileges remain continuously exposed, providing attackers with an extended window to operate undetected. JIT access mitigates this risk by enforcing time-limited privilege activation with additional controls such as approvals and conditional access policies, ensuring that high-risk permissions are granted only when needed and for a limited duration. This restriction minimizes the attack surface, disrupts lateral movement, and forces adversaries to trigger access requestsâ€”actions that can specially monitored, build detections on top off, and denied when not expected. Without JIT, compromised admin accounts grant indefinite control, allowing attackers to disable security controls, erase logs, and maintain stealth, amplifying the impact of a compromise.
